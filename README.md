# trashMe

Please note that I purposely made this program in an inefficient way. There was a person who I was describing this to that had little to no programming experience, so it was
made with the idea that the reader does not understand many programming concepts beyond the first semester of college.

I know there is a much better and efficient way to program this, but I decided to upload it instead of redoing it in case there is another person
out there who needs help understanding basic programming ideas to other people who are just beginning their programming journey.

Thanks!
